A app for generating seed based Starfield content

This is based on the work done on Mundusform / Undaunted.

Basically while playing Starfield I noticed there's a lot of good tilesets but a limited amount of place POI's.

Startiller currently builds new Worldspace POIs by combining existing prefabs in a grid.

Will add docs soon
