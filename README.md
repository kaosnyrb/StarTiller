# Seedstarfield
A app for generating seed based Starfield content

This is based on the work done on Mundusform / Undaunted.

Basically while playing Starfield I noticed there's a lot of good tilesets but a limited amount of place POI's.

Mundusform was based on hand crafted block files, which was time consuming. I'd tried to capture existing layouts to little success.

Seedstarfield is built on top of https://github.com/Mutagen-Modding/Spriggit which can convert esp to yaml.

This means that we can export blocks from the CS to yaml and then use them as blocks.
